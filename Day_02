# 📊 Day 2: Understanding Linear Regression

Welcome to Day 2 of my 100 Consistent Days of Machine Learning challenge! 🚀  

Today, I explored Linear Regression, one of the most fundamental Machine Learning algorithms.  

### 🔎 What is Linear Regression? 
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values based on input features.  
💡 Key Idea: It finds the best-fit line (linear relationship) between independent variables (X) and dependent variable (Y).  


### 📌 Mathematical Representation  
A simple Linear Regression equation:  

Y = mX + b

where:  
- Y = Predicted value (label)
- X = Input feature  
- m = Slope (determines how X affects Y)  
- b = Intercept (the value of Y when X = 0)  

💡 The goal is to find the best values of m and b that minimize the error.  


### ⚙️ How Does It Work?  

1️⃣ Model Training – The algorithm learns from labeled data (X, Y).  
2️⃣ Finding the Best Line – It minimizes the Mean Squared Error (MSE).  
3️⃣ Making Predictions – Once trained, it can predict Y for new values of X.  

🔢 Example Use Cases:  
✅ Predicting house prices based on size.  
✅ Forecasting sales revenue based on ad spend.  
✅ Estimating temperature based on humidity.  


### 📈 Evaluating the Model  

We measure the model’s accuracy using:  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) – Measures average squared differences between predicted and actual values.  
- R² Score (Coefficient of Determination) – Measures how well the model fits the data (closer to 1, the better).  


### 🎯 What’s Next?  
For Day 3, I'll explore Multiple Linear Regression – extending today's concept to multiple input features! 🔥
